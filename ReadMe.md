# **Muffin's Treasure Hunting Tool** 🐾✨  
*Muffin is here to sniff out your crypto treasures!*

## **What Does This Tool Do?**
Muffin's Treasure Hunting Tool scans your computer for any potential crypto-related files, such as wallet backups, recovery phrases, or sensitive keys. It searches through all your storage drives (internal and external) for keywords related to cryptocurrency wallets, private keys, and other important crypto-related information.

The results are saved in:
1. A **text file** for easy viewing.
2. A **spreadsheet** for advanced filtering and sorting.

- **Searches for Crypto Wallets and Keys**: Includes popular and older wallet names like MetaMask, Phantom, and Electrum.
- **Supports All Drives**: Automatically scans all internal and external drives.

## üê∂ What Does This Tool Do?

Muffin's Treasure Hunting Tool scans your computer for crypto-related files, such as wallet backups, recovery phrases, or sensitive keys. It searches through all storage drives (internal and external) for keywords and patterns related to cryptocurrency wallets, private keys, seed phrases, and other important crypto goodies.

## üöÄ Features

- **Search for Crypto Wallets and Keys**: Includes keywords like "crypto," "wallet," "bitcoin," "ethereum," "password," and more. Supports popular and legacy wallet names like MetaMask, Phantom, Electrum, and many others.

- **Seed Phrase Detection**: Muffin sniffs out potential seed phrases by looking for sequences of 12, 15, 18, 21, or 24 words from the BIP39 mnemonic wordlist, even in files without extensions!

- **Scans File Contents**: Dives deep into the contents of `.txt`, `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`, and `.json` files for relevant keywords and seed phrases.

- **Handles Image Files Intelligently**: Scans `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.gif` files if their filenames match relevant keywords, catching those sneaky screenshots of private keys or seed phrases.

- **Includes Hidden Files**: Muffin doesn't miss a spot! Hidden files and folders are included in the hunt (unless blocked by your system).

- **Dynamic Drive Scanning**: Automatically detects and scans all available drives, including external flash drives. You choose which drives Muffin should explore.

- **Smart Filtering**: Skips common system and program folders to focus on where treasures are likely hidden.

- **Friendly Console Display**: Enjoy real-time progress updates with fun emojis and messages from Muffin.

- **Error Logging**: Any hiccups during the hunt are logged separately, so Muffin can focus on finding treasures.

- **Easy-to-Read Results**: Outputs results to both a detailed text file and a filterable spreadsheet with clickable paths.

- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
